Outfit Image classification- Deep Learning CNN

The global fashion industry is valued at three trillion dollars and accounts for 2 percent of the world's  GDP. The fashion industry is undergoing a dramatic transformation by adopting new computer vision and machine learning and deep learning techniques.
In this project I build a virtual stylist assistant that looks at customer Instagram and Facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags, dresses and pants.
The virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaigns.
In this story we're going to use the fashion immanence data.
It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses.
And we're asking the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.

I build a model to look at images and tell us exactly what category in this image. Whether itâ€™s a short, bag or hat and so on.
The model is artificial intelligence based deep learning model that can classifies images to different categories or different classes.

One of the main objectives of this is that once we classify for example that this customer loves for example dresses, so that means we can do kind of targeted marketing to that specific customer.
So for example if we classify this for example you know like lady loves let's say blue dresses then
we can target different blue dresses to her.
Maybe of different texture different material and so on so forth is a lot of ideas that can
be built around that.
In this case study I assume just grayscale images and I classified these grayscale images into 10 classes and categories.
